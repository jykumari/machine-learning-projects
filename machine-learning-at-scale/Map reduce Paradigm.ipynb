In particular, while we chunked our data so it can be processed by multiple mappers, we're still streaming the entire dataset through one reduce script. If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines. In case, we split the word counts in half after sorting them, and then perform the reducing on two separate machines, there can be issue of duplicate words. Same set of words can exist in both the files, that can lead to miscount of words once all the words are put together at the end.\n",

Put a check in place for separation while splitting up the data on to two machines. If a word exists in reducer 1, add the second matching word to the same reducer 1. If it doesn't exist, then send that new word to the second reducer. In this way, we can ensure that the one word group won't be separated into two different reducers and thereby eliminating the duplicate."

    "\n",
    "> __c)__ In case of word count algorithm, Ideal algorithm criteria does not hold true. Increasing our partitions does not improve the runtime, in fact, at many partitions, it gets worse. One reason for this can be the bottle neck in merging of the partitions before being given to the reducer. Another reason can be the single reducer slowing down the computation. The communication cost can also play a major role here, as we see that with increase in the number of partitions beyond 8, the communication cost is starting to take over and dominate the total time.\n",
